# HQ9~ (or HQ9Tilde)
The addition to HQ9+ with some new things!
It's an esoteric programming language. It's an addition of the HQ9+ programming language. Here's how HQ9+ works:
- Input "h" in it to output "Hello World!"
- Input "q" in it to output "Q"
- Input "9" in it to output the 99 bottles of beer song
- Input "+" in it to get a number that is an addition of the previous number. At first, it's 1, then 2, then 3, and it continues.
I added more functions to it!
